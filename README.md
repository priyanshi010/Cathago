# Document Scanning & Matching System

## Overview
This project is a **self-contained document scanning and matching system** that allows users to upload documents, scan them for similarity, and request additional credits. It includes **session-based role authentication using JWT** and a credit system for limiting document scans. The system provides an **admin dashboard** for analytics and credit approvals.

## Features
- **User Authentication** (JWT-based login & role management)
- **Document Upload & Scanning**
- **Text Similarity Matching** (TF-IDF Cosine Similarity)
- **Daily Free Credits System (Auto Reset at Midnight)**
- **Admin Credit Approval System**
- **Activity Logging & User Statistics**
- **User & Admin Dashboards**

---

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express.js), SQLite (Database), JWT (Authentication)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Storage:** Local file storage for document uploads
- **Session Management:** JWT-based authentication

---

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Node.js** and **SQLite** installed on your system.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayyush1738/Doc-Scanning.git
   cd Doc-Scanning
   cd Backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

4. Open the frontend by launching `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
